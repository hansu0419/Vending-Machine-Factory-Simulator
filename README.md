# Vending-Machine-Factory-Simulator
Vending or “automatic retailing” has its roots traced back as far as 215BC. However, it was only in the
early 1880s that the first commercial coin-operated vending machines were introduced in London,
England which dispensed postcards. Now, modern vending machines offer more variety of products
ranging from drinks, tickets, snacks, WIFI connections, and many more. In Japan, vending machines are
designed to function during blackouts, particularly in the wake of earthquakes and aftershocks, thus
utilizing vending machines as an emergency aid.
In an effort to invoke an appreciation of the many fascinating automation wonders of our modern era, We created a vending machine simulator.
